pull nearest city data
but, which city is nearest to me? what can i filter by so that i don't have to scroll through 345 results?
what does the data table look like, what information does it contain that i can filer on?

SELECT *
FROM city_list
LIMIT 5;

from this i see that there are two columns, city and country
i can filter for only "United States" to get a smaller list to scroll through

SELECT city
FROM city_list
WHERE country = 'United States';

This gives me 52 results, which is much easier to scroll through
Sacramento is on the list, so I will continue with that as my nearest city

Extract Sacramento data
Let's take a look at what type of data, and column headers are contained in the city_data sheet

SELECT *
FROM city_data
LIMIT 5;

We have year (num), city (string), country (string), and avg_temp (num)

Now to only pull Sacramento
SELECT *
FROM city_data
WHERE city = 'Sacramento';

This gives 165 results, but the columns city ('Sacrameto') and country ('United States') are not important and redunant, so I'll repull the data without those columns

SELECT year, avg_temp
FROM city_data
WHERE city = 'Sacramento';

This also gives 165 results, so I'm confident I've captured them all.
Click "Download CSV"

Now to download the global data
I'm curious to see how this table is structured

SELECT *
FROM global_data
LIMIT 5;

The only two columns in this table are 'year' and avg_temp.

Now, I'll download and export to CSV.

SELECT *
FROM global_data;

i moved both of these files to my google drive (to keep organized) and then renamed them sacramento_weather.csv and global_weather.CSV

I'll use Excel from here on about
